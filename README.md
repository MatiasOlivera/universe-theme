**This theme was crafted with the accessibility in mind**, for all and especially those with visual impairment. It achieves the accessibility standards outlined in the WCAG 2.0, specifically the ones related to the text contrast ratio.

**Why is it important to me?** Well, you probably **read source code during long periods of time** and you should not force yourself to read some text with poor contrast.
Even if you don't have visual impairments, **there are other factors that could affect the text readability, like direct sunlight, dark rooms**, etc. so it will help you anyway.
