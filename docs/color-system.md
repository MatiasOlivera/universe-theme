# The color system

## Color usage and palettes
The Material Design color system uses an organized approach to applying color to your UI. In this system, a primary and a secondary color are typically selected to represent your brand. Dark and light variants of each color can then be applied to your UI in different ways.

### Colors and theming
Your app’s primary and secondary colors, and their variants, help create a color theme that is harmonious, ensures accessible text, and distinguishes UI elements and surfaces from one another.

### Principles

#### Hierarchical
Color indicates which elements are interactive, how they relate to other elements, and their level of prominence. **Important elements should stand out the most.**

#### Legible
Text and important elements, like icons, should meet legibility standards when appearing on colored backgrounds, across all screen and device types.

#### Expressive
Reinforce your brand by showing brand colors at memorable moments that reinforce your brand’s style.

## Color theme creation

### Primary color
**A primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your app’s screens and components.** If you don’t have a secondary color, your primary color can also be used to accent elements.

#### Dark and light primary variants
You can make a color theme for your app using your primary color, as well as dark and light primary variants.

#### Distinguish UI elements
To create contrast between UI elements, such as distinguishing a top app bar from a system bar, you can use light or dark variants of your primary color on each elements. You can also use variants to distinguish elements within a component, such different variants used on a floating action button container, and the icon within it.

### Secondary color
**A secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your product.** Having a secondary color is optional, and should be applied sparingly to accent select parts of your UI.

Secondary colors are best for:
- Floating action buttons
- Selection controls, like sliders and switches
- Highlighting selected text
- Progress bars
- Links and headlines

#### Dark and light secondary variants
Just like the primary color, your secondary color can have dark and light variants. You can make a color theme by using your primary color, secondary color, and dark and light variants of each color.

### Surface, background, and error colors
Surface, background, and error colors typically don’t represent brand:
- Surface colors affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus.
- The background color appears behind scrollable content.
- Error color indicates errors in components, such as invalid text in a text field.
