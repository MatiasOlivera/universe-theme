### Color

Color is a great way to provide status information, give feedback in response to user actions, and help people visualize data.

#### Use color judiciously for communication.
In general, color should be used sparingly, like when you need to call attention to important information.

#### Be aware of colorblindness.
Many colorblind people find it difficult to distinguish red from green (and either color from gray), or blue from orange. Avoid using these color combinations as the only way to distinguish between two states or values.

#### Use sufficient color contrast ratios.
Insufficient contrast in your app makes content hard to read for everyone. Icons and text might blend with the background, for example. An online color contrast calculator can help you accurately analyze the color contrast in your app to ensure that it meets optimal standards. Strive for a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1, although 7:1 is preferred because it meets more stringent accessibility standards.

#### Consider how nearby artwork and translucency affect colors.
Color can lose its impact when composited over a non-neutral or translucent background, or when used adjacent to a very bright, colorful image.

#### Test your app’s color scheme under a variety of lighting conditions.
Lighting varies significantly based on room ambiance, time of day, and more. Colors you see on your computer at design time won’t always look the same when using your app in an environment with bright ambient light conditions. Always preview your app under multiple lighting conditions, including outdoors with a laptop on a sunny day, to see how colors appear. Adjust colors to provide the best possible viewing experience in the majority of use cases.

### Dark mode

#### Adopt vibrancy in your interfaces
Vibrancy improves the contrast between foreground and background colors, making your foreground content appear more prominent

### Typography

#### Emphasize important information
Use font weight, size, and color to highlight the most important information in your app.
